## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Azure Cloud & DevOps Engineer** specializing in **cloud migration**, **CI/CD automation**, and **deployment workflows** using **Azure DevOps**.  
At **DXC Technology**, I contribute to a large-scale enterprise modernization program where I:

- Build & maintain **CI/CD pipelines** for legacy-to-cloud migration  
- Create **automated deployment workflows** with reusable YAML templates  
- Manage **segregated Azure cloud environments** (App Service, SQL, Storage, Functions, VMs)  
- Work with **Docker, Containerization, and Kubernetes (AKS)**  
- Improve cloud automation and optimize deployment processes  

My career began in **full-stack engineering**, which helps me design DevOps workflows that align well with developer needs and modern delivery practices.

I focus heavily on:
- Cloud automation  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Kubernetes (AKS)  
- CI/CD and DevOps engineering  
- Cloud-native observability  
- Deployment reliability and performance
